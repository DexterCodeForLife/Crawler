Link Testing
	About
		Crawler::Link represents a link, splitted into specific URI parts (scheme, authority, path, query and fragment).
		It is not only used to store link specific data, but to fetch content by using HTTP sockets.
		
	Constructor based parsing
	Crawler::Link::Link ( const std::string & )
		Create a Crawler::Link object and use the constructor based parser using URIs.		
		Use the accessors to verify that everything works properly.
		
	Creating a string from a Crawler::Link object
	std::string Crawler::Link::toString ( )
		Create a Crawler::Link object and use the constructor based parser using URIs.
		After that print the return value of Crawler::Link::toString and verify the output.
		The output should be the same as the used URIs.
		
	Requesting content from a website
	std::string Crawler::Link::requestContent ( )
		Create a Crawler::Link object and use the constructor based parser using some URIs.
		After that print the return value of requestContent.
